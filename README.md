## About
This is a 2-player chess game developed for grade 12 computer science course in collabortion with Dean D'mello and Daniel Montus. The game is designed to be beginner friendly and informative so that players can learn chess rules and enjoy the game at the same time. 

Basic as well as complex chess rules, ranging from moving a pawn to castling and check checking, are implemented to block invalid moves and output an appropriate error message about what was wrong with that move and how to do it right.

Players can save the progress at any point throughout the game, then the program saves the game in a single text file which then allows players to re-load whenever they want to resume.

# How to play
First, you have to download ChessGame.java, ChessGame.class, and all .class files in the Classes folder. Then, place all the files into the same folder and open ChessGame.java file with RTP compiler. Press Run button on the top left corner of the window.

The game uses two console windows, user interaction&instruction and graphic game board window, so place these windows side by side so that you can see both windows at the same time. Note that you must type in other commands as **lower case** and coordinates as **UPPER CASE**.

# Potential improvements
- Implement stalemate, en passant, and checkmate checker
- Develop AI to play against for single player mode
